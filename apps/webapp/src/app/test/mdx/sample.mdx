# Sample MDX Component

This is a **standalone MDX file** that demonstrates clean, GitHub-style markdown rendering.

## Features Demonstrated

- Clean typography with proper spacing
- **Bold** and *italic* text without over-styling
- Lists with consistent spacing
- Code blocks with clean syntax highlighting
- Professional blockquotes

### Code Example

```typescript
// TypeScript interface example
interface MDXProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}

// Component example with clean formatting
export function MDXWrapper({ children, className }: MDXProps) {
  return <div className={className}>{children}</div>;
}

// No more weird bold text in code blocks!
const cleanCode = "properly formatted";
```

### Lists

1. First ordered item with proper spacing
2. Second ordered item
3. Third ordered item

Unordered list:
- Clean bullet point one
- Clean bullet point two  
- Clean bullet point three

### Links and Quotes

> This blockquote demonstrates clean styling without italic text, following GitHub's modern approach. It has a subtle background and clean border styling.

Visit the [home page](/) to see more examples with clean link styling.

### Inline Elements

Here's some text with `inline code` that's not bold and **bold formatting** that's appropriately weighted.
