# Code Sharing Benefits

## What We Accomplished

Successfully reduced code duplication between the mobile app and webapp by sharing common React components and hooks.

## Shared Components

### From @workspace/webapp:

- **AppInfoProvider** - Context provider for app configuration data
- **useAppInfo** - Custom hook for accessing app info context
- **All related TypeScript types** - AppInfo, AppInfoContextValue, etc.

### Mobile-Specific:

- **ConvexClientProvider** - Handles Expo/React Native environment configuration
- **Environment setup** - Uses EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL and app.config.js

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated ~75 lines of duplicated code
2. **Single Source of Truth**: App info logic maintained in one place
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Mobile and web apps behave identically for shared features
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Updates to AppInfoProvider automatically apply to both platforms
5. **Type Safety**: Shared types ensure consistency across platforms
6. **Better Testing**: Test once, benefit everywhere

## Architecture Principles

- **Platform-specific code stays separate** (ConvexClientProvider)
- **Business logic is shared** (AppInfoProvider, useAppInfo)
- **Environment configuration is platform-appropriate** (.env.local vs EXPO*PUBLIC*\*)
- **Import/export patterns are clean** (index.ts files for easy imports)

## Future Opportunities

This pattern can be extended to share:

- Authentication providers and hooks
- Theme providers
- Other business logic components
- Utility functions
- Validation schemas

The key is to identify React components that are platform-agnostic and share those while keeping platform-specific code (like environment handling) separate.
