# Code Sharing Benefits

## What We Accomplished

The mobile app is now completely independent from the webapp, with its own implementation of shared business logic patterns.

## Mobile-Specific Components

### Native to Mobile:

- **AppInfoProvider** - Mobile-specific context provider for app configuration data
- **useAppInfo** - Mobile-specific custom hook for accessing app info context
- **ConvexClientProvider** - Handles Expo/React Native environment configuration
- **All related TypeScript types** - AppInfo, AppInfoContextValue, etc.

### Shared Backend:

- **@workspace/backend** - Common Convex backend shared between mobile and webapp
- **Environment setup** - Uses EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL and app.config.js

## Benefits

1. **Platform Independence**: Mobile app has no dependencies on webapp code
2. **Easier Deployment**: Mobile app can be built and deployed independently
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Clear separation between mobile and web platforms
4. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to webapp won't break mobile app
5. **Type Safety**: Platform-specific types ensure consistency within each platform
6. **Reduced Complexity**: No cross-platform dependencies to manage

## Architecture Principles

- **Complete platform separation** - Mobile and webapp share only the backend
- **Duplicated business logic where necessary** - Ensures platform independence
- **Environment configuration is platform-appropriate** (.env.local vs EXPO*PUBLIC*\*)
- **Clean import/export patterns** - index.ts files for easy imports within each platform
- **Shared backend only** - Common data layer through Convex

## Future Considerations

While we maintain platform separation, we could consider:

- Shared utility libraries as separate packages
- Common type definitions in a shared package
- Shared validation schemas as a separate package
- Backend-only shared logic

The key is to maintain platform independence while potentially sharing truly platform-agnostic utilities through dedicated packages rather than direct imports.
