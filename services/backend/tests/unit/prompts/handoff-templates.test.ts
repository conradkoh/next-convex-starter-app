      **Planning Feedback (Enhancer → Planner)** — complete every section below. Do not omit sections, principles, or XML wrappers:

      When a section has no content, write exactly \`Not Applicable.\` — no explanation, no em-dash, no additional text.

      The planner sent you three XML sections. Your job is **advisory adversarial review** — raise risks, challenge assumptions, align with user intent. Be **specific and targeted**: cite concrete claims, files, UX choices, and gaps from the check-in so the planner can improve the plan without re-synthesizing vague feedback.

      Give **concrete, actionable recommendations** in every section. End with **Recommendations** (second-last: summarized suggestions, tradeoffs, and considerations) then **Suggested edits** (last: proposed edits to grounding and the builder-handoff with file paths and code snippets). For UI work, complete the optional **UX** section using the reference below. **Do not rewrite their full builder brief.** The planner makes the final call.

      ### UX review checklist
      Complete the optional **UX** section in your output when the planner proposes UI changes. Write exactly "Not Applicable." for non-UI tasks. Put code snippets in **Suggested edits** only.

      1. **Flows** — primary action ≤3 clicks? simpler path exists?
      2. **Patterns** — matches existing components? recommend one if multiple. mobile vs desktop (md: variants vs separate mobile UI)?
      3. **Layout** — compact title+menu row, description, trailing end-aligned CTA? unnecessary wrappers?
      4. **Shortcuts** — consistent with catalog below? gaps or conflicts?

      ### Flow complexity
      - Primary action ≤3 clicks from entry point
      - Extend existing surfaces (palette, settings tab, row action) before new navigation
      - Avoid nested modal chains and unjustified multi-step wizards
      - Prefer inline actions over navigate-away-and-back

      ### Presentation & responsive patterns
      - Reuse existing components: \`CommandPalette\`, industrial dialogs, \`ChatroomLoader\`, timeline row chrome
      - Match badge/button patterns from timeline (\`BADGE_BASE\`, \`navButtonClass\` in All-tab)
      - When multiple valid patterns exist, recommend one and explain tradeoff
      - **md: breakpoint** (768px) splits mobile vs desktop
      - **Hide/show:** \`hidden md:flex\` / \`flex md:hidden\` for alternate chrome
      - **Mobile overlay:** fixed sidebar overlay with backdrop (\`md:hidden\`)
      - **Separate mobile UI:** dedicated mobile modal/picker when desktop uses side panel
      - **Shared responsive density:** same component, \`md:\` size variants (\`h-7 md:h-9\`)
      - **Command dialogs:** industrial theme via \`commandDialogStyles.ts\`, top-anchored, max-w-[90vw]

      ### Layout simplification
      - Review card/section layouts for unnecessary rows, nested wrappers, or misaligned actions
      - Prefer compact rows: title and overflow menu (⋮ \`MoreVertical\` popover) on one line via flex/grid
      - Description on the next line; primary CTA (e.g. "View Details") on a trailing row aligned end
      - Canonical simplified card pattern:
        \`\`\`
        <title>          <overflow-menu ⋮>
        <description>
                         <primary-cta aligned end>
        \`\`\`
      - Reuse \`CardHeader\` + \`CardAction\` grid (\`grid-cols-[1fr_auto]\`) or equivalent flex \`justify-between\`
      - Flag multi-row chrome that could collapse (menu on its own row, CTA left-aligned when end-aligned matches existing cards)

      ---

      **Delegation Brief (Planner → Builder)** — paste into the handoff message. Include every field that applies. **Omit fields that do not apply** — do not write \`Not Applicable\` as filler.

      **Division of labor:** You (planner) own architecture and API shape. The builder implements exactly what you specify and does not redesign or invent alternatives unless blocked.

      **Detail bar:** Specify down to **every file** the builder will create or modify (full repo paths). Include code snippets — types, signatures, stubs, or target implementations — until a competent builder **cannot misinterpret** what to write. Vague layers ("update the backend", "fix the component") are not acceptable.

      ## Summary
      <brief context for this delegation slice — what problem it solves and where it fits in the larger task>

      ## Goal
      <one sentence: the outcome this slice delivers>

      ## Key Knowledge for High Quality Bar
      <details that would move the implementation from good to excellent and delightful — domain context, user expectations, edge cases, naming, UX polish, invariants the builder must preserve>

      ## Force Multipliers
      <choices that greatly simplify the solution while preserving long-term maintainability — reuse existing abstractions, avoid unnecessary layers, leverage platform conventions>
      - Each builder delegation starts a fresh session automatically — the builder does not continue prior context.

      ## Files to implement (exhaustive, file-level)
      List **every** file in this slice. Mark each file **(Required)** or **(Optional)** — all Required files must land before PR. For each file, state the exact change and paste the code the builder should match (no guessing).

      - [ ] I confirm that I have seen this template at the start of any planning, before working on or delegating any task to the team
      - [ ] I confirm that I've read and followed the role guidance before starting any work
      <!-- Role guidance is static for your role and does not change between tasks.

You do not need to re-read it on every task if you have already read it once. -->

      ## Proof of Planning
      <!-- REQUIRED. List planning steps for trivial single-step tasks, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      - <step 1: concrete artifact or outcome>
      - <step 2: concrete artifact or outcome>

      ## Proof of Principles
      <!-- REQUIRED: Complete every principle below. Write an explanation for each, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation when the principle does not apply — do not omit this section or skip any principle bullet. -->
      - **Semantic Consistency:** <how this work demonstrates semantic consistency, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- Semantic Consistency: the organization of the code, the code and the functionality of the code use a consistent and well maintained set of terms. -->

      - **Organization & Maintainability:** <how this work demonstrates organization & maintainability, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- Organization & Maintainability: a small change in requirements should result in a small change in code in a small number of files and folders. -->

      - **Reducing Optionality:** <how this work demonstrates reducing optionality, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- Reducing Optionality: code contains the minimum number of code paths to support the functionality required presently. -->

      - **Static Evaluability and Provability:** <how this work demonstrates static evaluability and provability, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- Static Evaluability and Provability: the system's behavior should be provably correct by looking at the source code, then automated tests, then manual tests, in this order. -->

      - **No Revisit:** <how this work demonstrates no revisit, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- No Revisit: implemented in a way so the user does not have to revisit this implementation again. -->

      - **Leave It Better:** <how this work demonstrates leave it better, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- Leave It Better: leave the code in a slightly better state than before when touching files. -->

      <!-- REQUIRED. List backlog items addressed if none were in scope, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      - \`backlog-item-id\` — <backlog item title/summary and how this work addresses it>

      ## Backlog Pending User Review Confirmation
      <!-- REQUIRED. Complete the attestation if no backlog items apply, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      - [ ] I confirm that every backlog item implemented in this work has been moved to \`pending_user_review\` via \`chatroom backlog mark-for-review\` after the feature was verified end-to-end and a PR was raised for user review
      - PR URL(s): <link to PR(s)>

      ## Code Change Verification

      - <schema design, modules, interfaces, domain entities — what you chose and why>

      ## Key Tradeoffs
