      - Static Evaluability and Provability: the system's behavior should be provably correct by looking at the source code, then automated tests, then manual tests, in this order.
      - No Revisit: implemented in a way so the user does not have to revisit this implementation again.
      - Leave It Better: leave the code in a slightly better state than before when touching files.

      <how this work follows the principles above — localized changes, readable structure, correctness provable from source then tests>

      ### Proof of Completion
      - [ ] I confirm that I read the current chatroom task context using the command below and that the goal stated in that context has been met
      <!-- Read context before handoff if not already done this task: \`CHATROOM_CONVEX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3210 chatroom context read --chatroom-id="000000000000010002chatroom_rooms" --role="solo"\`. State the context goal and confirm it was achieved. -->
      <!-- File references (clickable in workspace UI): use repo-relative paths with a file extension — e.g. \`apps/webapp/src/modules/chatroom/foo.ts\` or [apps/webapp/src/foo.ts](apps/webapp/src/foo.ts). Avoid absolute paths, file:// prefixes, and paths without / or extension. -->
      - \`apps/webapp/src/path/to/file.ts\` — <what changed and why>
      <evidence the goal was met — list every file you (or the builder) modified>

      ## Backlog Tasks Implemented
      - \`backlog-item-id\` — <backlog item title/summary and how this work addresses it>
      <Omit if no backlog items were in scope.>

      ## Backlog Pending User Review Confirmation
      - [ ] I confirm that every backlog item implemented in this work has been moved to \`pending_user_review\` via \`chatroom backlog mark-for-review\` after the feature was verified end-to-end and a PR was raised for user review
      - PR URL(s): <link to PR(s)>
      <Omit this section if no backlog items apply.>

      ## Code Change Verification
      - [ ] I confirm that I have run typecheck and tests for the project (only required if code changes were made)

      ## Key Technical Decisions
      - <schema design, modules, interfaces, domain entities — what you chose and why>

      ## Key Tradeoffs
      - <what was weighed against what, and why you chose this path>

      ## Tech Debt Observed
      - <issues noticed but intentionally left out of scope of this change>

      ## System Design
      <include a mermaid diagram when the change has non-trivial structure; omit for trivial changes>

      ## Unresolved Decisions
      <!-- Decisions that need user input before work can proceed. Omit this section when there are no open decisions. -->
      - <decision or question — options considered, recommendation if any>
      <Carry forward decisions still open from earlier handoffs in this chatroom. Remove items the user has resolved. Do not decide on the user's behalf unless they explicitly asked you to.>

      ## Notes
      <anything the user should know — context, caveats, or observations not covered above. Omit if none.>
