      They **cannot** see:
      - Anything you write in this agent session (including direct replies like "Hello!")
      - Progress reports
      - Tool output

      Put your **complete** deliverable in the handoff message — not in session text.

      **Report Template (Planner → User)** — complete every section below. Do not omit sections, principles, or XML wrappers:

      - **Reducing Optionality:** <how this work demonstrates reducing optionality, or exactly "Not Applicable.">

      ⚠️ **CRITICAL — Recipient visibility**

      The user **only** receives the text inside your \`handoff --next-role="user"\` command.

      They **cannot** see:
      - Anything you write in this agent session (including direct replies like "Hello!")
      - Progress reports
      - Tool output

      Put your **complete** deliverable in the handoff message — not in session text.

      **Report Template (Solo → User)** — complete every section below. Do not omit sections, principles, or XML wrappers:

      When a section has no content, write exactly \`Not Applicable.\` — no explanation, no em-dash, no additional text.

      <what was accomplished, in plain terms — no references to prior messages>

      ## What changed
      <high-level view of what changed since the user's message>

      ## Template Disclosure Confirmation
      - [ ] I confirm that I have seen this template at the start of any planning, before working on or delegating any task to the team
      - [ ] I confirm that I've read and followed the role guidance before starting any work
      <!-- Role guidance is static for your role and does not change between tasks. Run once if needed: \`CHATROOM_CONVEX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3210 chatroom get-role-guidance --chatroom-id="000000000000010002chatroom_rooms" --role="solo"\`. You do not need to re-read it on every task if you have already read it once. -->

      ## Proof of Planning
      <!-- REQUIRED. List planning steps for trivial single-step tasks, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      - <step 1: concrete artifact or outcome>
      - <step 2: concrete artifact or outcome>

      ## Proof of Principles
      <!-- REQUIRED: Complete every principle below. Write an explanation for each, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation when the principle does not apply — do not omit this section or skip any principle bullet. -->
      - **Semantic Consistency:** <how this work demonstrates semantic consistency, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- Semantic Consistency: the organization of the code, the code and the functionality of the code use a consistent and well maintained set of terms. -->

      - **Organization & Maintainability:** <how this work demonstrates organization & maintainability, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- Organization & Maintainability: a small change in requirements should result in a small change in code in a small number of files and folders. -->

      - **Reducing Optionality:** <how this work demonstrates reducing optionality, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- Reducing Optionality: code contains the minimum number of code paths to support the functionality required presently. -->

      - **Static Evaluability and Provability:** <how this work demonstrates static evaluability and provability, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- Static Evaluability and Provability: the system's behavior should be provably correct by looking at the source code, then automated tests, then manual tests, in this order. -->

      - **No Revisit:** <how this work demonstrates no revisit, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- No Revisit: implemented in a way so the user does not have to revisit this implementation again. -->

      - **Leave It Better:** <how this work demonstrates leave it better, or exactly "Not Applicable.">
      <!-- Leave It Better: leave the code in a slightly better state than before when touching files. -->

      ## Proof of Completion
      - [ ] I confirm that I read the current chatroom task context using the command below and that the goal stated in that context has been met
      <!-- Read context before handoff if not already done this task: \`CHATROOM_CONVEX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3210 chatroom context read --chatroom-id="000000000000010002chatroom_rooms" --role="solo"\`. State the context goal and confirm it was achieved. -->
      <!-- File references (clickable in workspace UI): use repo-relative paths with a file extension — e.g. \`apps/webapp/src/modules/chatroom/foo.ts\` or [apps/webapp/src/foo.ts](apps/webapp/src/foo.ts). Avoid absolute paths, file:// prefixes, and paths without / or extension. -->
      - \`apps/webapp/src/path/to/file.ts\` — <what changed and why>
      <evidence the goal was met — list every file you (or the builder) modified>

      ## Backlog Tasks Implemented
      <!-- REQUIRED. List backlog items addressed if none were in scope, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      - \`backlog-item-id\` — <backlog item title/summary and how this work addresses it>

      ## Backlog Pending User Review Confirmation
      <!-- REQUIRED. Complete the attestation if no backlog items apply, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      - [ ] I confirm that every backlog item implemented in this work has been moved to \`pending_user_review\` via \`chatroom backlog mark-for-review\` after the feature was verified end-to-end and a PR was raised for user review
      - PR URL(s): <link to PR(s)>

      ## Code Change Verification
      - [ ] I confirm that I have run typecheck and tests for the project (only required if code changes were made)
      </handoff-proofs>

      <handoff-direction>
      ## What exists today
      <!-- REQUIRED. Describe current state after this work, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      <current state after this work — what the user can now do, what is in place, how the system behaves>

      ## Key Technical Decisions
      <!-- REQUIRED. List decisions, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      - <schema design, modules, interfaces, domain entities — what you chose and why>

      ## Key Tradeoffs
      <!-- REQUIRED. List tradeoffs, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      - <what was weighed against what, and why you chose this path>

      ## System Design
      <!-- REQUIRED. Include a mermaid diagram when the change has non-trivial structure, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->

      \`\`\`mermaid
      flowchart TD
          A[Component] --> B[Component]
      \`\`\`

      <handoff-notes>
      ## Notes
      <!-- REQUIRED. Write notes if none, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      <anything the user should know — context, caveats, or observations not covered above>
      </handoff-notes>

      <handoff-action>
      ## Tech Debt Observed
      <!-- REQUIRED. List tech debt, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      <!-- Severity: prefix each Tech Debt and Unresolved Decision bullet with [high], [medium], or [low] -->
      - [high] <critical issue — blocks correctness, security, or release>
      - [medium] <meaningful debt — should address soon>
      - [low] <minor cleanup — nice to have>
      - <issues noticed but intentionally left out of scope of this change>

      ## Unresolved Decisions
      <!-- REQUIRED. List open decisions needing user input if none, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      <!-- Severity: prefix each Tech Debt and Unresolved Decision bullet with [high], [medium], or [low] -->
      - [high] <critical issue — blocks correctness, security, or release>
      - [medium] <meaningful debt — should address soon>
      - [low] <minor cleanup — nice to have>
      - <decision or question — options considered, recommendation if any>
      <Carry forward decisions still open from earlier handoffs in this chatroom. Remove items the user has resolved. Do not decide on the user's behalf unless they explicitly asked you to.>

      ## Manual steps
      <!-- REQUIRED. List manual steps outside the system, or write exactly "Not Applicable." with no explanation. Do not omit this section. -->
      <steps the user must take outside the system — deploy, configure credentials, run commands, verify in production, etc.>
