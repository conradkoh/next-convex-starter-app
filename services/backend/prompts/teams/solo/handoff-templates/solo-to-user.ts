## Summary
<what was accomplished, in plain terms — no references to prior messages>

## Template Disclosure Confirmation
- [ ] I confirm that I have seen this template at the start of any planning, before implementing any code for this task
${getRoleGuidanceDisclosureBlock(roleGuidanceContext)}

## Proof of Planning
<!-- Demonstrate the goal was decomposed into actionable steps with clear outcomes before implementation. -->
- <step 1: concrete artifact or outcome>
- <step 2: concrete artifact or outcome>
<Omit for trivial single-step tasks.>

## What changed
<high-level view of what changed since the user's message before the detailed proofs below>

${PROOF_OF_PRINCIPLES_HEADING_H3}
${getHandoffQualityPrinciplesCommentBlock()}
<how this work follows the principles above — localized changes, readable structure, correctness provable from source then tests>

### Proof of Completion
${getContextReadDisclosureBlock(roleGuidanceContext)}
${getFileReferenceProofOfCompletionExample()}
<evidence the goal was met — list every file you modified>

## Backlog Tasks Implemented
- \`backlog-item-id\` — <backlog item title/summary and how this work addresses it>
<Omit if no backlog items were in scope.>

## Backlog Pending User Review Confirmation
- [ ] I confirm that every backlog item implemented in this work has been moved to \`pending_user_review\` via \`chatroom backlog mark-for-review\` because a PR has been raised for user review
- PR URL(s): <link to PR(s)>
<Omit this section if no backlog items apply.>

## Key Technical Decisions
- <schema design, modules, interfaces, domain entities — what you chose and why>

## Key Tradeoffs
- <what was weighed against what, and why you chose this path>

## Tech Debt Observed
- <issues noticed but intentionally left out of scope of this change>

## System Design
<include a mermaid diagram when the change has non-trivial structure; omit for trivial changes>
