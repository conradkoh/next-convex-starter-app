**Division of labor:** You (planner) own architecture and API shape. The builder implements exactly what you specify and does not redesign or invent alternatives unless blocked.

**Detail bar:** Specify down to **every file** the builder will create or modify (full repo paths). Include code snippets — types, signatures, stubs, or target implementations — until a competent builder **cannot misinterpret** what to write. Vague layers ("update the backend", "fix the component") are not acceptable.

\`\`\`markdown
## Summary
<brief context for this delegation slice — what problem it solves and where it fits in the larger task>

## Goal
<one sentence: the outcome this slice delivers>

## Key Knowledge for High Quality Bar
<details that would move the implementation from good to excellent and delightful — domain context, user expectations, edge cases, naming, UX polish, invariants the builder must preserve>

## Force Multipliers
<choices that greatly simplify the solution while preserving long-term maintainability — reuse existing abstractions, avoid unnecessary layers, leverage platform conventions>

## Files to implement (exhaustive, file-level)
List **every** file in this slice. Mark each file **(Required)** or **(Optional)** — all Required files must land before PR. For each file, state the exact change and paste the code the builder should match (no guessing).
${getFileReferenceGuidanceComment()}

### \`apps/webapp/src/path/to/file.ts\`
**Change:** <precisely what to add, modify, or remove in this file>

\`\`\`typescript
// Target code: exports, types, function bodies, component skeleton, query/mutation shape, etc.
// Enough that the builder can implement this file without inventing structure
\`\`\`

### \`apps/webapp/src/path/to/other-file.ts\`
**Change:** <...>

\`\`\`typescript
// ...
\`\`\`

(Add one ### block per file. If this slice touches only one file, still use the ### header.)

## Shared contracts (planner-owned)
Cross-file types, interfaces, or patterns that apply beyond a single file. Omit if everything is already specified per-file above.

### Interfaces & types
\`\`\`typescript
// Shared signatures, schemas, props, or DB shapes
\`\`\`

### Reference snippets
\`\`\`typescript
// Canonical call patterns, hook usage, imports, or wiring between files
\`\`\`

## Requirements (acceptance criteria)
- <verifiable outcome the builder can self-check>
- Include at least one check that the feature is **verified end-to-end**. Unit tests alone are insufficient for new features.

## What to avoid
- <anti-patterns, recurring mistakes, or scope creep for this slice — be explicit>
- <e.g. "Do not add new abstractions", "Do not refactor unrelated files", "Do not change existing public APIs">

## Skills to activate
- <e.g. chatroom skill activate code-review --chatroom-id=<id> --role=builder>

## Out of scope
- <files or areas the builder must NOT touch in this slice>

## Session Augmentation
Valid values: \`none\` | \`compact\` | \`new_session\`
- \`none\` — continue prior session context
- \`compact\` — run in-session context compaction (native SDK harnesses only)
- \`new_session\` — start a completely new session (default)
// data:agent.session_augmentation=new_session

Keep one slice ≈ one focused review surface. Delegate slices incrementally — one at a time, not all at once.`;
